# slashcord
Adds annotation and utils for slash commands for Discord

This library is created for/dependent on [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord)

This library comes with two favors of code:

- Defining a command so that it can be registered (and synced) with Discord
- Annotations for handling the commands themselves
